Dataset of natural human anxiety &amp; cardiac-overlap symptom language for health LLMs
# ACOS-H — Anxiety–Cardiac Overlap Set (Human)

ACOS-H is a structured dataset of natural, first-person narratives
describing anxiety, panic, and heart-related physical sensations.

## Why this exists
Health chatbots and symptom triage systems often mis-handle anxiety-driven
physical symptoms—either escalating fear or under-escalating perceived risk.
This dataset targets that exact edge case.

## What’s included
- Natural human language (not clinical summaries)
- Structured fields covering sensation, context, interpretation, and response
- Emphasis on anxiety vs perceived cardiac danger overlap

## Intended use
- Health chatbots
- Symptom triage systems
- LLM evaluation and safety testing
- RAG or fine-tuning workflows

## Status
The full dataset is private.
A 50-row preview and schema are available on request.
